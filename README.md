# Breast-Cancer-Analysis
The project uses the UCI dataset (569 records, 31 attributes) to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant with decision tree (95% accuracy) and random forest (96% accuracy) models. It includes preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and feature importance analysis.
